Love and Verantwortung - The politics of self curation is an intermedial lecture-performance about platforms, decentralization, love and self-curation written by Malte Kobel, Laura Weber and Andreas Dzialocha.

"BLATT 3000 is a magazine and equally likes to think of itself as a platform - for exchange, for discourse, for opinions, for ideas (on and about music). BLATT 3000 wants to know what platforms really are and what it means to be one without too heavy curation. BLATT 3000 likes self-curation. We think self-curation is a positive twist of traditional hierarchies - a collective curatorial effort might end up like a self-flourishing mushroom, an Unkraut that grows uncontrollably. We like that. But do we actually want to change the music landscape that we all are engaged in? And if so how? Sometimes BLATT 3000 dreams. That is why BLATT 3000 will present a concept of a festival of the future."

## Performance

UNM Nordisk Musik 2016 - Festival for contemporary music and sound arts @ Rytmisk Sal, Musikhuset Aarhus DK - 16.08.16 http://www.ungnordiskmusik.dk/

## Sourcecode

The whole performance is based on three custom software solutions named mission control. These applications enable us to perform the lecture on three separated screens with audio, video and image media plus interactive typing on screen and speech-synthesis. All clients are connected with each other within a local network.

The audience is able to interact with the performance by using a webapp. With a special USB bridge-interface it is possible to gather the audiences data from the internet even inside the local network.
