HOFFNUNG 3000 is a festival for music, art and theory. It is an experiment in social, artistic and theoretical collaboration.

HOFFNUNG 3000 is the process of organising a festival, a festival that creates itself. Through each and every participant.

HOFFNUNG 3000 invites 30 practitioners into a collective creation mode. No top down curation, but self-curation.
